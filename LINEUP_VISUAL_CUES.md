## ðŸ”„ **Workflow with Visual Cues**

1. **Select a slot** from the "Required Slots" column (highlights in blue)
2. **Click an available player** from the roster (they get assigned)
3. **Watch the magic happen**:
   - The slot turns **green with a checkmark** âœ“
   - The player becomes **grayed out with "ASSIGNED" label** ðŸš«
   - Both are immediately updated in the interface

4. **Try to click an assigned player** â†’ Alert prevents duplicate assignment
5. **Use "Clear All"** â†’ All visual cues reset to default state

## ðŸŽ¨ **Color Coding**
- **Green**: Completed/Filled (slots with players assigned)
- **Red/Gray**: Used/Unavailable (players already assigned)
- **Blue**: Selected (currently selected slot)
- **Default**: Available for interaction

This makes it much easier to see at a glance which positions are filled and which players are still available for assignment!
