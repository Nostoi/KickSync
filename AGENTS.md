## Agent Execution Framework

### 1. Task Identification Process

When executing tasks from the improvement plan:

```python
# Agent Decision Tree
def identify_next_task(current_phase, completed_tasks):
    """
    Priority order for task execution:
    1. HIGH: Phase 1 items (if any remaining)
    2. MEDIUM: Phase 2 Feature Enhancements  
    3. LOW: Phase 3 Advanced Features
    """
    if current_phase == "Phase 1":
        return get_foundation_tasks()
    elif current_phase == "Phase 2":
        return get_enhancement_tasks()
    else:
        return get_advanced_tasks()
```

## Agent Execution Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards

```python
# Required for all agent-generated code
STANDARDS = {
    "type_hints": "All functions must have complete type annotations",
    "docstrings": "Google-style docstrings for all public methods",
    "error_handling": "Robust exception handling with specific error types",
    "testing": "Unit tests for all new functionality",
    "backward_compatibility": "Must not break existing functionality"
}
```

### Testing Requirements

```bash
# Agent must run these commands after any changes
python test_structure.py           # Verify structure integrity
python -m pytest tests/           # Run all unit tests (when created)
python run_desktop.py             # Manual verification - desktop app
python run_web.py                 # Manual verification - web app
```

### File Modification Patterns

**When modifying existing files:**

1. **Read entire file** to understand context
2. **Preserve existing functionality** completely
3. **Add new features** as extensions, not replacements
4. **Update imports** and dependencies as needed
5. **Add comprehensive docstrings** for new methods
6. **Maintain backward compatibility** with existing data

**When creating new files:**

1. **Follow existing patterns** from similar files in the project
2. **Use proper imports** from the established structure
3. **Include comprehensive error handling**
4. **Add type hints throughout**
5. **Create corresponding test files** in `tests/` directory

### Integration Points

**Critical integration points to respect:**

```python
# Core models - extend carefully
src/models/player.py          # Player data structure
src/models/game_state.py      # Game state management

# Core services - integrate with
src/services/timer_service.py      # Game timing logic
src/services/persistence_service.py # Data persistence

# UI integration points
src/ui/tkinter_app.py         # Desktop interface
src/ui/web_app.py             # Web interface
frontend/src                  # Web frontend modules
```

### Data Persistence Strategy

**Current system:** JSON-based persistence via `PersistenceService`

**Agent guidelines:**

- **Extend JSON schema** for new data fields
- **Maintain backward compatibility** with existing save files
- **Add migration logic** if schema changes significantly
- **Consider SQLite migration** for complex analytics (Phase 2.4)

### UI Development Patterns

**Tkinter Desktop (src/ui/tkinter_app.py):**

```python
# Pattern for adding new views
class NewFeatureView(ttk.Frame):
    def __init__(self, parent, controller):
        super().__init__(parent)
        self.controller = controller
        self._build_ui()
    
    def _build_ui(self):
        # Build interface components
        pass
    
    def on_show(self):
        # Called when view becomes active
        self.refresh()
    
    def refresh(self):
        # Update display with current data
        pass
```

**Web Interface (frontend/src + templates + web_app.py):**

```html
<!-- Pattern for new web features -->
<div class="panel" id="new-feature-panel">
  <div class="section-title">New Feature</div>
  <!-- Feature content -->
</div>

<script>
// JavaScript for feature interaction
function handleNewFeature() {
  // Implementation
}
</script>
```

## Agent Decision Matrix

### Task Selection Criteria

| Factor | Weight | Considerations |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| **Business Value** | 40% | Direct benefit to coaches/players |
| **Implementation Complexity** | 30% | Development effort required |
| **Risk Level** | 20% | Potential to break existing functionality |
| **Dependencies** | 10% | External services or major refactoring needed |

### Implementation Priority

```python
TASK_PRIORITY = {
    "Phase 2.1 - Advanced Timer": "COMPLETED",       # ✅ All timer features implemented
    "Phase 2.2 - Player Management": "COMPLETED",    # ✅ Enhanced player profiles complete  
    "Phase 2.4 - Data Analytics": "COMPLETED",       # ✅ Full analytics with CSV export
    "Phase 2.3 - Strategy Tools": "HIGH",            # Formation builder, substitution planning
    "Phase 3.x - Advanced Features": "MEDIUM"        # Future considerations
}
```

## Debugging and Validation

### Required Validation Steps

```bash
# Agent must execute these steps after any modification
cd /path/to/soccer_coach

# 1. Structure verification
python test_structure.py

# 2. Import verification
python -c "from src import *; print('All imports successful')"

# 3. Functionality verification
python run_desktop.py &  # Test desktop app
python run_web.py &      # Test web app

# 4. Legacy compatibility
python coach_timer.py &  # Test legacy desktop
python app.py &          # Test legacy web
```

### Common Pitfalls for Agents

1. **Breaking Backward Compatibility**
   - Always test legacy entry points
   - Don't modify existing method signatures
   - Extend, don't replace existing functionality

2. **Incomplete Error Handling**
   - Wrap file operations in try/catch
   - Handle missing dependencies gracefully
   - Provide meaningful error messages

3. **Ignoring Existing Patterns**
   - Study existing code structure before adding new features
   - Follow established naming conventions
   - Maintain consistency with existing UI patterns

4. **Inadequate Testing**
   - Test both Tkinter and web interfaces
   - Verify data persistence works correctly
   - Check edge cases and error conditions

## Success Criteria

### For Each Task Completion

```yaml
Definition of Done:
  - ✅ Feature implemented according to specification
  - ✅ All existing functionality preserved
  - ✅ Both UI interfaces updated (desktop + web)
  - ✅ Comprehensive error handling added
  - ✅ Type hints and docstrings complete
  - ✅ Structure verification test passes
  - ✅ Manual testing completed successfully
  - ✅ Backward compatibility maintained
```

### Project Health Metrics

```python
HEALTH_METRICS = {
    "functionality_preservation": "100%",  # No regression
    "test_coverage": ">80%",               # When test suite created
    "documentation_coverage": "100%",      # All public methods documented
    "type_annotation_coverage": "100%",   # All functions typed
    "backward_compatibility": "100%"      # Legacy entry points work
}
```

## Agent Communication Protocol

**Files Modified:** [List of files changed]
**Testing Status:** [Pass/Fail/Not Started]
**Backward Compatibility:** [Verified/Issues Found]
**Next Steps:** [What's next or blockers encountered]
```

### Error Reporting

```markdown
