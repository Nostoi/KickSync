## Technical Improvements

### Backend Enhancements
```python
# Proposed service layer architecture
class TimerService:
    def start_game(self) -> None
    def pause_game(self) -> None
    def add_stoppage_time(self, seconds: int) -> None
    def get_game_status(self) -> GameStatus

class PlayerService:
    def add_player(self, player: Player) -> str
    def update_playing_time(self, player_id: str, seconds: int) -> None
    def get_fairness_report(self) -> FairnessReport
    def suggest_substitutions(self) -> List[SubstitutionSuggestion]
```

### Database Migration
```python
# Move from JSON to SQLite for better data management
class GameDatabase:
    def __init__(self, db_path: str):
        self.db_path = db_path
        self.init_tables()
    
    def save_game_state(self, game: GameState) -> None
    def load_game_state(self, game_id: str) -> GameState
    def get_player_history(self, player_id: str) -> List[GameRecord]
```

        self.timer_thread = threading.Thread(target=self._timer_loop)
        
    def _timer_loop(self):
        while self.running:
            # Update game state
            self.update_queue.put(current_state)
            time.sleep(0.1)  # 100ms updates
```
